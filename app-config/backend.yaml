proxy:
  ### Example for how to add a proxy endpoint for the frontend.
  ### A typical reason to do this is to handle HTTPS and CORS for internal services.
  # endpoints:
  #   '/test':
  #     target: 'https://example.com'
  #     changeOrigin: true

# see https://backstage.io/docs/permissions/getting-started for more on the permission framework
